# After code review :
* no use of propTypes           ok.
* no prettier           ok. What's your favorite please ?
* presence of ternaries in ternaries            Yes once in ./Presentational/MessahesList.js but how could it be better ?
* use of class component (prefer function component)            Yes. There are more functional than class components
* not the same indentation from one file to another         Yes once in ./Container/AppThreads.js, ok.
